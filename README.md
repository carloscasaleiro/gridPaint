"Grid Paint" is a simple Java graphics program that lets you create and manipulate a grid of colored cells using keyboard inputs.
<p></p>

You can move the cursor using arrow keys and perform various actions:

 <ul>
        <li>Arrow Keys: Move the cursor in different directions (up, down, left, right).</li>
        <li>Space Key: Fill the cell under the cursor with a vibrant green color.</li>
        <li>D Key: Delete the cell currently under the cursor.</li>
        <li>W Key: Save the current state of cells to a file.</li>
        <li>L Key: Load previously saved cells from a file, with a random color.</li>
        <li>C Key: Effortlessly clear all cells from the grid.</li>
 </ul>
